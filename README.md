# Automated classification of synaptic vesicles in electron tomograms of *C. elegans* using machine learning
(https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0205348)

These tools can classify segmented neuronal vesicles as clear core- and dense core vesicles (CCV, DCV). 
They are optimized for neuronal vesicles in *C. elegans* adult hermaphrodite and dauer larval vesicles in neuromuscular junctions that are segmented by 3D ART VeSElecT (https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005317), but can be adapted to a wide range of data.
